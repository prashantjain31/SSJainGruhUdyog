This app helps customers to choose snacks and their quantity,
create a virtual bill and the order is sent via email. I made this project to support
my family's side-business. This project uses the Implicit Intent functionality of
android to send the whole order list to an app which can handle emails, similarly
for the contact page Implicit Intent is used to make calls to the owner of the app.
